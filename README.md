- 👋 Hi, I’m @agriades
- 👀 I’m interested in creative things! 2D and 3D digital arts, gaming stuff, some sort of UI design, even pop music producing I guess.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to make a blog on github! I wanna make fluid portfolio/blog for my works, because it can be very random but represents who I am.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on... wait I don't think I am capable of any collaboration yet. I wanna join game developing project someday though.
- 📫 How to reach me: well, I'll make comment section on my blog.
